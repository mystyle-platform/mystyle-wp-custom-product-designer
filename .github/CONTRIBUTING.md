## Coding Guidelines

- **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)**
- Install [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer). It'll help with the Coding Standards.
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code is compatible with PHP 5.2+.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the MyStyle repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained by MyStyle developers.

Please **don't** modify the changelog or update the .pot files. These are maintained by the MyStyle team.
